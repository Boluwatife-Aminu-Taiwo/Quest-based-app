# Quest-based App in Web3

### This is the front-end of this app. It integrates the features of creating quests and objectives for users to perform and submit. it also checks on the update of these users and gives authority to an admin to approve some quests

## Tools

### REACT

```shell
npx create-react-app quest-app
cd quest-app
npm run start
```

## possible improvements

1. design the front-end better.
2. make it a fully automative app on web3 that allows admin set a task and allows users participate and also reward the participation
3. design it as an employer-employee interaction where employees do task given be the employers.
